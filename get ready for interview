SQL Profiler is a tool which allows system administrator to monitor events in the SQL server. 
This is mainly used to capture and save data about each event of a file or a table for analysis.

Local temporary tables are visible when there is a connection, and are deleted when the connection is closed.
CREATE TABLE #<tablename>

Global temporary tables are visible to all users, and are deleted when the connection that created it is closed.
CREATE TABLE ##<tablename>

What is CHECK constraint?
A CHECK constraint can be applied to a column in a table to limit the values that can be placed in a column. 
Check constraint is to enforce integrity.

SQL server can be connected to any database which has OLE-DB provider to give a link. 
Example: Oracle has OLE-DB provider which has link to connect with the SQL server group.
